# Using GAICO for analyzing results
GenAI Results Comparator, [GAICo](https://pypi.org/project/GAICo/), is an open Python library from the author's research group to help compare, analyze and visualize outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), often against a reference text. In doing so, one can use a range of extensible metrics from the literature. This folder gives an example of how to do it. 

- More details are at the tool's [GitHub](https://github.com/ai4society/GenAIResultsComparator).
- It is suggested to run this in a virtual environment.

## Creating virtual environments

An example - environment name is gaico-venv

```
python3 -m venv gaico-venv
./gaico-venv/bin/activate
```
