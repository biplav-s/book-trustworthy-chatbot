# AI Testcase (TC) template and sample testcases

One can find a template for building AI (chat) testcases [here](testcase-template.md). As a simple example, see the illustrative testcase for a chatbot that could deal with [US states and their capitals](testcase-example-usstatescapital.md). 


Additionally, in the sub-folders, sample testcases are for:

* [Election](election-sample-testcases)
* [Finance](finance-sample-testcases)
* [Health](health-sample-testcases)
* [Customer Support](customersupport-sample-testcases)
